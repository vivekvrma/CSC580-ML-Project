# Project Title: Asteroid Diameter Prediction

## Overview
The project aims to enhance our understanding of asteroid distribution across the solar system, utilizing observational data published JPLâ€™s solar system dynamics (SSD) group. Subsequently, it focuses on predicting asteroid diameters through the application of machine learning techniques. The work includes careful selecting of the features from the data, using the correlation matrix plot and recursive feature elimination (RFE). The selected features is used to train a two-layer neural network to model the prediction. The result are compared with a existing analysis and the work shows better results based upon metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared(R2). The prediction of the size of the asteroids are based on their brightness, size, orbit configuration around the Sun.
